# Introduction
This project will (hopefully) lead to an Android app that allows users to save and customize lyrics to songs they listen to on streaming platforms like Spotify. It will also include other functionalities like uploading the lyrics to the app database so that others can use and rate this upload. More features will be added as the project progresses toward the final product.
